# COMP2011-Check-Code

This single python file is used to check the test cases provided by the lab (or maybe PA). It is used to replace zinc auto grader function as zinc no longer provide Standard I/O Test anymore.

To use the checker, put `main.py` with your lab source code in the same folder. Create a folder `testcase`. Put all the input and output inside `testcase`

In macOS and Linux, run the following in your terminal:

```py
python3 main.py
```
In Windows, run the following in your terminal/command prompt:
```py
python main.py
```
